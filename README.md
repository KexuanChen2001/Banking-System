# Banking-System
## Banking account system : 
Coded in Java, this program: <br>
1. Supports the establishment of bank accounts, including both credit and non-credit accounts. <br>
2. Facilitates various account operations through a command-line interface, such as viewing balances, depositing funds, withdrawing cash, and transferring money. <br>
3. Provides corresponding error messages for issues encountered, for example, 'UnknownCustomerException' and 'NotEnoughMoneyException'. <br>
4. Features a visualization tool for monitoring historical account balance fluctuations. <br>
5. Records monetary transactions and preserves in a binary file for data retention.<br>

## How to use it
1. Start by opening the GUI and use the intuitive interface to explore and operate the banking system. For detailed explanations, refer to the comments within the code.<br>
2. Important: Before running the program, delete existing binary file ('UIC Bank.bin', which you can rename if desired). Otherwise, the Bank constructor will load outdated account data from the binary file, potentially altering the outcome of your tests.
